# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `for` statement?

I feel not super confident in the fluency with the 'for' statements.

- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?

Today I struggled a little bit on the for statements. I understood the material during the lesson but when we went into break out rooms I seemed to lose everything I had just learned. I had some unproductive stuggle after that so then I took a break and ate lunch and when I came back to work i had some productive struggle.

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that

I think I just need to read over how to for statements again. I hope that we will have some more practice in the pairing tomorrow that will allow me to figure it out with a partner.

- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?

I figured out this lesson so I don't have any question right now, just more practice will make me more comfortable with these statements.
